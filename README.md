**Overview:**
In this project my aim is to analyze engagement behavior across social media platforms to uncover patterns that reflect customer preferences, campaign performance timing, and content strategies.

**Raw Dataset**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/divyaraj2006/social-media-engagement

**Key Questions that I will be focusing on are:**
1. Which types of content formats show the highest interaction levels?
2. How does engagement vary across digital platforms?
3. Are there optimal times or days to publish for maximum customer engagement?
4. What role does customer sentiment play in engagement success?
5. Do high-performing posts (top 10%) share common features?
