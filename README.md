## Executive Summary
Social media marketers waste budget on low-performing platforms and posting times without data-driven guidance. This analysis reveals that Instagram drives 2.2x higher engagement than Twitter, with video and poll formats outperforming static content by 60%. Peak engagement occurs during off-peak hours (1 AM, 9 AM, 9 PM), challenging traditional posting schedules. By reallocating budget to Instagram video content posted during these windows on Sundays and Fridays, marketing teams can increase engagement rates by 20-30%.

## Business Problem: 
Social media marketers face limited resources and need to optimize content strategy across multiple platforms. Without data-driven insights on platform performance, content formats, and optimal timing, marketing teams risk wasting budget on low-engagement channels and ineffective posting schedules.
